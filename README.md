# buggyrace

Racing post-apocalyptic buggies across wastelands in Python. Includes hamsters.

This is the documentation repo that is published via GitHub Pages at
[https://www.buggyrace.net](https://www.buggyrace.net)

### Development note

These docs are generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). If you want to
run them locally (for example, to edit them), you'll need Ruby
(see the [Jekyll installation docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)).
Once Ruby and the Jekyll gem is installed, you can fire up the Buggy Racing
docs locally with:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

...and then look on `http://localhost:4000`.
