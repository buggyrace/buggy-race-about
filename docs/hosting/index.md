# Installation & Hosting

To run the project, you need to be running the *race server* that provides the
web site that is both the main source of information for both students and
staff, but also accepts the JSON data that is the output of the applications
the students are developing (their "buggy editors"). The students do **not** do
their development work on the race server.

To start with, students submit their data by copy-and-pasting it — later, they
might program their app to use the server's API.

If you run with all the project features enabled, the server will also
distribute the source code the students need to start working by automatically
forking it into their own GitHub repo and inject project tasks as issues. It
also encourages students to store notes as they go (which can later be exported
as the basis of their project development report).
