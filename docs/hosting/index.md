# Installation and Hosting

To run the project, you need to be running the **race server** that provides the
web site that is both the main source of information for students and
staff, and also accepts the JSON data that is the output of the applications
the students are developing (their "buggy editors").

There are basically two ways to host this — either self-host (on your own
or your institution's infrastructure, or on a third-party hosting provider),
or in the cloud, using Heroku.

The students do **not** their programming work on the race server — that
happens on their own machines (or in the cloud): see [Where to run the
app?](../buggy-editor/running-where).
