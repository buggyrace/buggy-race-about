# Heroku

The [race server repo](https://github.com/buggyrace/buggy-race-server) is suitable for running as an app on cloud-hosting server 
[Heroku](http://heroku.com).

You'll need to also configure a database.

For normal use (such as running the classes over a term), Heroku fees for the web app ("Basic dyno") are $7 per month, with Postgres database ("Mini") at $5. 

{: .warning}
These prices might be out of date!
Check the Heroku website for the latest fees.
