# Software shout-out

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org) project.

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is made available under a BSD
license.

The Buggy Editor uses an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.

The tech notes are published using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a static
site generator written in Python (we migrated the tech notes away from Jekyll
because the race server already has a dependency on Python).

The animated SVG diagrams are made with
[KeyShape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com) (Mac only), which exports JavaScript
released under the MIT license. The diagrams play step-by-step (with captions)
using [KeyshapeDiagram](https://davewhiteland.github.io/keyshape-diagram/docs)
(which was written for this purpose).

Some image tweaks were made in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), an open source
painting program. PNG optimisation by [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).

If the Buggy Racing project is useful to you, you (or your students) may also
benefit from [CompSci superbasics](https://superbasics.beholder.uk/).

The <a href="https://latex.now.sh/">LaTeX CSS stylesheet</a> (used to provide
the optional "fake LaTeX" feature of the tech notes) is by Vincent DÃ¶rig and is
available under the MIT License.

The tech notes theme itself is based on
<a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/pages-themes/hacker">jekyll-theme-hacker</a>
(licensed under CCO).

Version control by [Git](https://git-scm.com).

This documentation site is produced by Jekyll using the 
[Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com) theme, and is hosted on
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
