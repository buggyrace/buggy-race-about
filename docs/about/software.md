# Software & licensing

## License: GNU Affero GPL


{: .callout}
The race server and buggy editor are both made available under the
the **GNU Affero General Public License**: a free, copyleft license
(see [gnu.org for details](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)).

In practice this means: you and your institution don't have to pay to use it
— there's nothing to buy, because the whole thing is made freely, explicitly
available for you — and you can modify it and even improve it (but if you
do, you should make those improvements available to other people too).

See the [race server's LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/buggyrace/buggy-race-server/LICENSE.txt)

> This is free and open source software:  
> "Free as in speech, free as in beer"

Remember to teach your students about Open Source software :-)

## Software shout-out

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org) project.

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is made available under a BSD
license.

The Buggy Editor uses an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.

The tech notes are published using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a static
site generator written in Python (we migrated the tech notes away from Jekyll
because the race server already has a dependency on Python).

The animated SVG diagrams are made with
[KeyShape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com) (Mac only), which exports JavaScript
released under the MIT license. The diagrams play step-by-step (with captions)
using [KeyshapeDiagram](https://davewhiteland.github.io/keyshape-diagram/docs)
(which was written for this purpose).

Some image tweaks were made in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), an open source
painting program. PNG optimisation by [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).

If the Buggy Racing project is useful to you, you (or your students) may also
benefit from [CompSci superbasics](https://superbasics.beholder.uk/).

The <a href="https://latex.now.sh/">LaTeX CSS stylesheet</a> (used to provide
the optional "fake LaTeX" feature of the tech notes) is by Vincent Dörig and is
available under the MIT License.

The tech notes theme itself is based on
<a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/pages-themes/hacker">jekyll-theme-hacker</a>
(licensed under CCO).

Version control by [Git](https://git-scm.com).

This documentation site is produced by Jekyll using the 
[Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com) theme, and is hosted on
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
