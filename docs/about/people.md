# Buggy racing people

These are the humans behind the Buggy Racing project


## Dev team

* Dave Whiteland
* Tom Kuipers
* Jasper Lyons

---

## Hands-on teaching staff and feedbackers at RHUL

* Nery Riquelme-Granada
* Emma Lieu
* Mandy Warren
* Lizzie Wadsworth
* Joe Rowell

The Buggy Racing labs benefited from a crack team of Teaching Assistants
including Jack and Dylan.

## Technical implemention at RHUL
2023's server-hosted-on-a-VM trial was made possible because of 
_"yes we can"_ support from the RHUL CIM tech team:

* Adrian Thomas
* Narinder Sehra


## Support from the top down

Thank you to Professor Carlos Matos (Head of Department) for letting Buggy
Racing grow beyond RHUL CompSci with both moral and contractual support.

## Support from the ground up

A hamster high five to all the RHUL CompSci Foundation students who dived into
their projects and made great buggy editors.


## Software shout-out

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is made available under a BSD license.

The Buggy Editor uses an SQLite database.

The tech notes are published using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a static
site generator written in Python (we migrated the tech notes away from Jekyll
because the race server already has a dependency on Python).

The animated SVG diagrams are made with
[KeyShape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com) (Mac only), which exports JavaScript
released under the MIT licsense. The diagrams play step-by-step (with captions)
using [KeyshapeDiagram](https://davewhiteland.github.io/keyshape-diagram/docs)
(which was written for this purpose).

If the Racing Buggy project is useful to you, you (or your students) may also
benefit from [CompSci superbasics](https://superbasics.beholder.uk/).
