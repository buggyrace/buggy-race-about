## Hands-on teaching staff and feedbackers at RHUL

* Nery Riquelme-Granada
* Emma Lieu
* Mandy Warren
* Lizzie Wadsworth
* Joe Rowell

The Buggy Racing labs benefited from a crack team of Teaching Assistants
including Jack and Dylan.

## Technical implementation at RHUL
2023's server-hosted-on-a-VM trial was made possible because of 
_"yes we can"_ support from the RHUL CIM tech team:

* Adrian Thomas
* Narinder Sehra


## Support from the top down

Thank you to Professor Carlos Matos (Head of Department) for letting Buggy
Racing grow beyond RHUL CompSci with both moral and contractual support.

## Support from the ground up

A hamster high five to all the RHUL CompSci Foundation students who dived into
their projects and made great buggy editors.

## Illustrator

Thanks to Ren√© Carbonnell for the buggies and our _Mesocricetus roadentus_ 
hamster mascot.
