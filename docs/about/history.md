# History of the project

<div class="rhul">

<p>
The buggy racing project was originally created for the 1999–2020 cohort of
Foundation students in the
<a href="https://cs.rhul.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science</a> at
<a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk">Royal Holloway, University of London</a>
(RHUL).
</p>
<p>
We ran it for three years with the race server on the cloud (in Heroku), and
the explanatory tech notes published as a GitHub pages site.  
</p>
<p>
In late 2022 the work began to make the server customisable and "white labelled"
(so you can run it in/for your own institution).  
</p>
<p>
In 2023 (term 3 of the 2022–23 academic year) we ran the new server hosted on
the department's own network (using 
<a href="../hosting/docker">Docker in a VM</a>, instead of
<a href="../hosting/heroku">in the cloud</a>) to confirm that it was a feasible
approach . We also did some user-testing of the admin with the RHUL teaching
staff.
</p>
<p>
In June 2023 we started encouraging other educators to use Buggy Racing with
their own students.
