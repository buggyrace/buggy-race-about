# History of the project


{: .rhul}
The buggy racing project was originally created for the 1999–2020 cohort of
Foundation students at
[Royal Holloway, department of Computer Science](https://cs.rhul.ac.uk).  


We ran it for three years with the race server on the cloud (in Heroku), and
the explanatory tech notes published as a GitHub pages site.  

In late 2022 the work began to make the server customisable and "white labelled"
(so you can run it in/for your own institution).  

In 2023 (term 3 of the 2022–23 academic year) we ran the new server hosted on
the department's own network (instead of in the cloud) to confirm that it was a
feasible approach (using [Docker in a VM](../hosting/docker)). We also did some
user-testing of the admin with the RHUL teaching staff.

In June 2023 we started encouraging other educators to use Buggy Racing with
their own students.
