# Configuring the server

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Config** → Config:**Server**

The server config settings control aspects of the race server itself.

{: .note}
You may find that you can accept the default values for most (possibly all!)
settings — with the exception of `BUGGY_RACE_SERVER_URL`.

The `BUGGY_RACE_SERVER_URL` setting is **critically important** because there
are various places where race server needs to generate absolute URLs. It uses
this value (and not self-inspection) to determine what they should be.

{: .caption}
If the hostname of the server you've used to access the admin interface differs
from the `BUGGY_RACE_SERVER_URL`, the server will add a button to load the
current, active value.

## Config settings ("Server")

{: .config-settings}
| Setting  | Description   |
|----------|---------------|
| `BUGGY_RACE_SERVER_URL` | Full ("base") URL of this server.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `http://localhost:8000` |
| `BUGGY_RACE_SERVER_TIMEZONE` | The timezone the race server is running in (that's almost certainly the timezone you or your classes are in). In the database, all timezones are stored in UTC, but should be converted to this on the way between the server and your (and your students') screens. If this is an invalid timezone (according to Python's `pytz` module), it will revert to UTC.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `Europe/London` |
| `IS_STATIC_CONTENT_AUTOGENERATED` | The task list and tech notes do not get updated when you change config (or edit tasks): it's better to adopt the discipline of manually publishing both whenever you change config (which usally only happens before project has started). If `IS_STATIC_CONTENT_AUTOGENERATED` is set, the race server will automatically republish the task list and the tech notes whenever it reboots. This might have an impact on the server's performance, and it's currently somewhat experimental. Only switch this on if you are experiencing problems with the build.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
| `IS_REDIRECT_HTTP_TO_HTTPS_FORCED` | Should the webserver itself force HTTPS? **Be careful**: this setting will not be helpful if your hosting environment manages this for you (that is, only set this to `Yes` if you are certain HTTPS requests arrive directly to the app: if you have a process that's handling requests and connecting with this app locally over HTTP, forcing redirects with this setting may prevent _any_ requests getting through). HTTPS is mandatory for GitHub's OAuth authentication, or if you're holding any personal information on students... but _this setting does not implement HTTPS_ — it only forces redirection if the protocol the app sees in incoming requests is (non-secure) HTTP.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
| `IS_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_ALLOWED` | Normally, only a logged-in administrator who knows the `AUTHORISATION_CODE` can register new users. But if you accidentally end up unable to log in (deleted/demoted user, forgotten password) set this to `Yes` (or `1`) in the ENV to allow **emergency access** to the registration page, and create a new (admin) user. You'll also need to know the auth code (which can also be set via ENV if it's been lost).  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
| `IS_BUGGY_DELETE_ALLOWED` | Can a student delete their buggy? If not, the buggy exists once they've uploaded JSON data for it, and remains until changed by subsequent uploads (which is encouraged). This setting only controls whether students should be able to delete their own buggies (admins always can). If in doubt, choose `No`.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
| `API_SECRET_TIME_TO_LIVE` | The default time-to-live for a users' API secret, in seconds (for example, 3600 seconds = 1 hour).  <br><br> _Default value:_ `3600` |
| `IS_API_SECRET_ONE_TIME_PW` | Is the API secret _always_ a one-time password? If it is, it won't work after the first success (and needs to be reset). This does not affect the time-to-live of the secret. The default settings of this and `IS_STUDENT_API_OTP_ALLOWED` (`No` and `Yes` respectively) mean OTPs are not used except where students enable them on their own accounts.   <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
| `IS_STUDENT_API_OTP_ALLOWED` | Can individual students choose to set their own API secret to be different from the default one-time-password behaviour you've set with `IS_API_SECRET_ONE_TIME_PW`? For example, it's a little simpler for students to get the API working if it's not an OTP — but by setting this to `Yes` they can opt in or out.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `Yes` |
| `IS_SHOWING_RESTART_SUGGESTION` | Do you want the server to suggest you restart it after changing any config settings? Our experience is that normally changing config doesn't require a restart _but_ in case your implementation would benefit from this, you can switch the suggestions on.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
