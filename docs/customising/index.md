# Customising your Buggy Race server

The Buggy Racing project can be customised to suit your institution and the way
you want to run the project.

## Initial set-up

When you have [installed the race server](../hosting), the first time you visit
the server website it is in [the set-up phase](setup-phase). This takes you
through the ten steps of configuration setting groups. Most of the settings
have sensible default values, so this needn't take long.

However, we recommend you change config as little as possible once you've
registered students or started the project. So it's a good idea to go through
the set-up phase carefully (we recommend you get a cup of tea and a biscuit so
you don't rush it).

## Thereafter: you _can_ change config any time

{: .navigation}
**Admin** â†’ **Config**

Provided you are logged in as an administrator, you can change any of the
config settings at any time... although be careful about changing things after
students have already started.
