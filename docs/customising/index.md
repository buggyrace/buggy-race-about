# Customising your Buggy Race server

The Buggy Racing project can be customised to suit your institution and the
way you want to run the project.

When you have [installed the race server](../hosting), the first time you visit
it is in _setup mode_. This takes you through the ten steps of configuration setting groups. Most of the settings have sensible default values, so this shouldn't take long. 

However, we recommend you change config as little as possible once you've registered students or started the project. So it's a good idea to go through
the [set-up phase](setup-phase) carefully (we recommend you get a cup of tea and a biscuit so you don't rush it).

You _can_ go back later — via **Admin → Config** — and change any of these, at any time.
