# Configuring races

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Config** → Config:**Races**

The races are the incentive for students to develop good editors. You don't
_need_ to run races, but we recommend that you do!
 
See more about [running races](../running/running-races).


## Config settings ("Races")

{: .config-settings}
| Setting  | Description   |
|----------|---------------|
| `IS_USERNAME_PUBLIC_IN_RESULTS` | When you publish race results, are usernames (as well as the buggies' pennants) shown?  <br><br> _Default value:_ `Yes` |
| `DEFAULT_RACE_COST_LIMIT` | The default point cost threshold for buggies: you can always override this when you create each race.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `200` |
| `IS_RACE_VISIBLE_BY_DEFAULT` | Should a race be public as soon as you create it? If you choose `No`, you'll have to remember to publish a race in order for students to see it.  <br><br> _Default value:_ `No` |
