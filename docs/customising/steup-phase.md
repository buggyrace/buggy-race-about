# The set-up phase

When you visit your newly-installed race server for the first time, it will be in _setup mode_. This takes your through all the config settings, one step at a time. Each step covers a group of related settings. For most of these, you can accept the (sensible) defaults.

Don't worry if you get any wrong, because once you've finished, you'll be logged in as an administator, and can go back and change anything.
