# Static content

The task list, the tech notes and (if you are using it) the editor's source
code zip file are all explicitly published: that is, you need to generate them
on the server. Once you've done that, they don't change until you generate them
again.

This is for efficiency, but it can catch you out if you make any changes
_after_ you've published them. Remember to re-publish static content if you
change any config.

In practice, the material isn't expected to change once your project is running
anyway.

{: .warning}
Students will get 404 errors if they visit the URLs for static content before
you have published it.

{: .note}
You'll see a warning message if any static content has not been published. Look
in the [admin dashboard](../running/dashboard)
or the [set-up summary](../running/setup-summary).

{: .warning}
If you are hosting the race server on a system with an _ephemeral file system_
— such as [Heroku](../hosting/heroku) — static content does **not persist**
across restarts. You can remedy this by setting the
[config setting](../customising/server)
`IS_STATIC_CONTENT_AUTOGENERATED` in the "Server" group to `Yes`.
