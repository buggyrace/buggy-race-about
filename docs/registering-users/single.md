# Adding a single user

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Users** → **Register new user**

Use this form to register a single user. This is useful for adding more staff
accounts, or individual students.

The data (fields) you need to supply here depend on what you've configured
for users. You can change this — see [configuring users](../customising/users) —
but remember that if you add new fields, existing users won't have data in
those fields unless you [edit them](../running/user-management).

{: .note}
If you have a cohort of students to register, it's probably easier to register
them by [uploading from a spreadsheet](spreadsheet)
