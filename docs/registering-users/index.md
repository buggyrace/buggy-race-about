# Registering new users

Every student must be registered as a user on the race server. You can also
add your colleagues as staff users (administrators or Teaching Assistants).

At the end of the set-up phase, there will be one admin user in the system.

There are two ways to register new users:

* **[Add a single user](single)**  
  Fill in a form on the webserver to add a new user — this is useful for adding
  staff accounts or late-joining students.

* **[Load students from a spreadsheet](spreadsheet)**  
  Create a spreadsheet of enrolled students — if you're using a system like
  Moodle, Canvas, or Blackboard can extract something suitable from that — save
  it as a CSV file, and upload it. You'll need to make sure you have the right
  columns, but the race server has a utility to help you with that.

Once users are registered, you can change their details or suspend them: see
[user management](../running/user-management).
