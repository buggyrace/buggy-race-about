# Registering new users

Every student must be registered as a user on the race server. You can also
add your colleagues as staff users (administrators or Teaching Assistants).

At the end of the set-up phase, there will be one admin user in the system.

There are two ways to register new users:

* **[Add a single user](single)**  
  Fill in a form on the webserver to add a new user — this is useful for adding
  staff accounts or late-joining students.

* **[Load students from a spreadsheet](spreadsheet)**  
  If you've already got a list of enrolled students — especially if you're using
  a system like Moodle, Canvas, or Blackboard already — you can upload a CSV
  file.

Once users are registered, you can change their details or suspend them: see
[user management](../running/user-management).
