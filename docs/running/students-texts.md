# Viewing students' task texts

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Texts**  
or  
**Admin** → **Users** → _Individual user_

If you require your students to [produce a report](../teaching/report-and-poster),
and you are storing their texts on the race server, you can inspect these texts
both as a useful summary and in individual detail.

{: .note}
For more about using texts as a means of tracking your students' progress,
see the section on [teaching and tracking progress](../teaching/progress).

The "texts matrix" shows which texts your students have submitted.

The task text "matrix" shows which tasks students have saved notes against —
these can be downloaded to form their reports towards the end of the project.
You can click on a cell to view the student's text for the given task.

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Texts** → **Task text authors**

The race server provides another way of viewing this data, because sometimes
it's useful to be able to more easily see _which_ students have (and have not)
submitted a text.
