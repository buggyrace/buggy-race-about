# User management

{: .navigation}
**Admin** â†’ **Users**

There are three types of user:

* **Student**  
  Enrolled students

* **Teachiung Assistants**  
  Teaching Assistants (TAs) are staff users with mostly read-only access.  
  TAs may be able to set (i.e., change) students' passwords if the config
  setting `IS_TA_PASSWORD_CHANGE_ENABLED` is `Yes`.

* **Administrations**  
  Admins are staff users with full access to the admin features.
  Some admin changes require the admin user to also know the site's
  _authorisation code_.
