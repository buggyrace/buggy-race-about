# The admin dashboard

{: .navigation}
**Admin**

The admin dashboard shows a summary of activity including user activity.

### Purging unexpected settings

If you see this message:

    Unexpected config settings found in database

...together with one or more blue buttons marked **Purge**, it means that there
are config settings in your database which are no longer being used. This might
happen after a software update. It's safe to click each such blue button and
delete the deprecated config setting.
