# Set-up summary

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Config** → **Summary**

The set-up summary gives a breakdown of the main choices you've made when
configuring the server and how you are running the project.

It shows the main settings and also provides links if you want to change them.

There's also a link to the **System information** page if you need to check
settings (including which version of the server software is running).
