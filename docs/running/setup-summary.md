# Set-up summary

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Config** → **Summary**

The set-up summary gives a breakdown of the main choices you've made when
configuring the server and how you are running the project.

It shows the main settings and also provides links to the relevant admin pages
if you want to change them.

You're shown the set-up summary when you have completed the set-up phase, but
you can also return to it at any time once you've started using the server.

At the bottom of the page, there's a link to the 
[System information page](../customising/env#other-system-settings-system-info)
if you need to check settings (including which version of the server software
is running).
