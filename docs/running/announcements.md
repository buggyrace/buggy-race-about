# Announcements

{: .navigation}
**Admin** â†’ **Announcements**

You can publish (and hide) announcements that appear on the race server pages.

There are two types of announcement:

* **On every page**  
  Standard announcments are displayed at the top of every page (except the tech notes). You can choose from a set of preset styles that change the colour of
  the announcement.

* **On specific pages**  
  These announcements allow you to place messages in specific locations:
    * **Login**  
      The login announcement is displayed above the login form. Use this if
      you need to clarify to your students how/where you have supplied them
      with their login criteria
    * **Tagline**  
      The tagline is displayed on the race server's home page, underneath
      the main title.

## Editing announcements

You can choose to enable HTML in any announcement (set **Allow HTML** to `Yes`).
This allows you to use markup like `<strong>bold</strong>`.

{: .warning}
Be careful if you enable HTML in an announcement!  
It _is_ possible to break layout on pages if you do not close every tag that you
open.

{: .note}
When you change an announcement it will _always_ revert to being hidden. This
is effectively an "are you sure?" failsafe. You must always explicitly
**publish** an announcement after you've changed it.
