# Where to run the app?

## Or... where do the students do their dev work?

You can choose what works best for you or your students. It might be best that
all students do this the same way, or maybe you let them choose what works
best for them.

There are three main options:

---

* **[Run locally (student works on their own machine)](running-local)**  
  This includes working on machines in a college or a library.  
  **This is the simplest method** _provided the student can install Python3_
  and navigate the file structure well enough to get to work.  
  
  _Pro:_ students can work offline using their own tools.  
  _Con:_ there can be a lot of variation in environment between students; can be
  difficult to share/access student work.

---

* **Run in the cloud**  
  This approach bypasses the problem of setting up a Python environment because
  there are services out there that already come pre-installed.  
  Two examples in detail:  
  * **[Running on PythonAnywhere](running-pythonanywhere)**
  * **[Running on Replit](running-replit)**

  _Pro:_ dev environment is ready to roll (and is the same for
  all students); supports remote sharing.  
  _Con:_ students cannot easily work offline.

---
  
* **[Run on a remote server through VSCode](running-remote)**  
  This is a complete but complex solution, which might work for you if you want
  to use your institution's infrastructure (which may allow you to exploit other
  services already in place for students and management).
  
  _Pro:_ full control over activity on your own network.  
  _Con:_ more complex set-up; students cannot easily work offline.
