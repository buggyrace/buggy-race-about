# The students' buggy editor

At the start of the project, each student has the source code for a basic Flask
application called the _buggy editor_. It lets them edit the specification of a
racing buggy, and produces the JSON data that needs to be input to the race
server to enter races. The buggy editor is a working application, but it is
very limited: it simply lets you edit the number of wheels the buggy has. As
the students work through the project tasks, their buggy editors get
increasingly complex.

Before the project starts, you should make a fork of our buggy editor repo and
customise it to match your project. For example, the `README.md` and the
`app.py` should both ideally link back to your own race server. There's an
admin **buggy editor** page on the server to help you with the customisation.
