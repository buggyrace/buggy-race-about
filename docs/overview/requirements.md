# Requirements (what you need to run this)

If you want to run a Buggy Racing project, this is what you'll need:

* **Online access**  
  The project has an online component, so although students can do their
  development work offline, both they and you will need access to the web in
  order to access the race server.

* **Ability to host the race server**  
  You need to run the race server (it's the website you and your students
  interact with throughout the project). If you have the technical resource to
  host it yourself, you can — otherwise use a hosting service in the cloud:
  * See [more about self-hosting](../hosting/self-hosting).
  * For an example of cloud-based hosting, see [more about hosting on Heroku](../hosting/heroku).

* **Familiarity with Python, Flask, and basic SQL (and optionally Git)**  
  You and your staff will be guiding, teaching, and encouraging student
  developers — and helping debug them out of the corners they code themselves
  into. The application they are building (a [buggy editor](../buggy-editor))
  is a Flask webserver connecting to a SQLite database — so you need to know
  your way around that.

* **Students who know some Python**  
  See [more about the students](../teaching/students).

* **Ideally, staff to help you**  
  It's entirely possible to run this project alone, but the race server supports
  multiple staff accounts, including Teaching Assistants. See the information
  about [user management](../running/user-management).

* **About four weeks... or more**   
  How long the project takes to run can vary wildly depending on the experience
  of your students and how thoroughly you expect them to do the work. Although
  we've run it as a way to develop students' Python experience, it's feasible
  to run this project with the focus on web dev, UX design, or version control
  practices instead. Also, of course, it will depend on how much time you're
  expecting your students to spend on it each week.
