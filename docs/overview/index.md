# Overview


{: .rhul}
We designed this project for students with a range of experience, from new
programmers (1 term+) to some with web-dev experience. The project ran over 6
weeks with weekly programming lab sessions. Nobody is expected to complete all
the tasks â€” but we encouraged new programmers to aim to have attempted all of
phase 3 before the submission deadline.
