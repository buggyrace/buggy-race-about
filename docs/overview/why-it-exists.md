# Why this project exists

If you are:

* teaching in Higher Education (or similar)
* in need of an engaging Python programming project beyond a PDF worksheet
  or exercises in Jupyter notebook
* motivated by [pedagogic or design considerations like these](../about/design)
* unlikely to ever get the budget to pay someone to produce such a thing (or
  pay to use it if it already existed)

then this Buggy Racing might be what you'd create if you had the time and
web dev experience to put together. 

That's how this project came to be â€” a Teaching Fellow frustrated by how the
people best positioned to create such a thing (front-line programming teaching
staff) were unable to do so (because HE staff right now, especially in the
popular/oversubscribed field of Computer Science, are _overwhelmed_ with
teaching and marking duties) took some time out to make it happen. That also
explains why it's free.
