# Why this project exists

If you are:

* teaching in Higher Education (or similar)
* need to create an engaging Python programming project that's more than a PDF
  worksheet or series of exercises on Jupyter notebook
* are motivated by pedagogic [design considerations like these]
* unlikely to ever get the budget to pay someone to produce such a thing

then this Buggy Racing might be what you'd create if you had the time and
webdev experience to put together. 

That's how this project came to be — a Teaching Fellow frustrated by how the
people best positioned to create such a thing (front-line programming teaching
staff) and unable to do so (because HE staff right now, especially in the
popular/oversubscribed field of Computer Science, are _overwhelmed_ with
teaching and marking duties).

So that's how this project — specifically the full race server with features
that try to help the staff as well as the students, and the supporting tech
notes — came about. It was written for direct use, but then the teacher (Dave)
dropped out to make it all customisable and configurable so other people could
benefit from it to. It probably helped that he came from an Open Source/Civic
tech background where "user needs"-based development is more common than in
fields like academia.
