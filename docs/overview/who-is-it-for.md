# Who is it for?

## You are...

**...a teacher or Python tutor.**

You are at least moderately confident with Python and Flask (and you know enough
HTML, CSS and basic SQL to debug any pickles students get into). You've already
got your students familiar with the basics of the language and want to run an
engaging practical project over a few weeks.

You'd love to design your own project, but because you're very busy you don't
have the time available to produce it, with or without supporting materials.

You probably don't have a budget either, so it needs to be free.


## Your students are...

**...familiar with the basics of Python.**  
But their experience may vary:

* Perhaps they have never written a program more complex than a single-file
  script (or exercises in Jupyter notebooks)

Or...

* They _are_ more confident with Python but have never worked on a webserver
  before...

Or even...

* If they are more experienced — maybe they have competently used Flask before
  — they can be set to use the project to investigate more professional
  approaches, including use of Git (which is otherwise optional) and more
  sophisticated Python libraries.

{: .rhul}
We designed this project for students with a range of experience, from new
programmers (1 term+) to some with web-dev experience. The project ran over 6
weeks with weekly programming lab sessions. Nobody is expected to complete all
the tasks — but we encouraged new programmers to aim to have attempted all of
phase 3 before the submission deadline.

See **[about the students](../teaching/students)** in the _Teaching_ section
and the [design philosophy](../about/design) behind the project.
