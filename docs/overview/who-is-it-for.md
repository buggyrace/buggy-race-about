# Who is it for?

<div class="two-cols">
  <div class="callout callout-1">
    <h2 id="you-are">
      You are...
      a teacher or tutor of Python
    </h2>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-python-max.png" />
      <p>
        You are at least moderately confident with Python and Flask (and you
        know enough HTML, CSS and basic SQL to debug any pickles students get
        into). You've already got your students familiar with the basics of the
        language and want to run an engaging practical project over a few weeks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-time.png" />
      <p>
        You'd love to design your own project, but because you're very busy you
        don't have the time available to produce it, with or without supporting
        materials.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-coins.png" />
      <p>
        You probably don't have a budget either, so it needs to be free.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="callout callout-2">
    <h2 id="your-students-are">
      Your students are...
      familiar with the basics
    </h2>
    <p>
      But their experience may vary:
    </p>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-python-min.png" />
      <p>        
        Perhaps they have never written a program more complex than a
        single-file script (or exercises in Jupyter notebooks)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-python-mid.png" />
      <p>
        <em>or...</em><br>
        they are more confident with Python but have never worked on a
        webserver before...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item-card">
      <img class="decal" src="/docs/img/overview-python-max.png" />
      <p>
        <em>or...</em><br>
        maybe they have competently used Flask before. They can be set to use
        the project to investigate more professional approaches, including use
        of Git (which is otherwise optional) and more sophisticated Python
        libraries.
      </p>

{: .rhul}
We designed this project for students with a range of experience, from new
programmers (1 term+) to some with web-dev experience. The project ran over 6
weeks with weekly programming lab sessions. Nobody is expected to complete all
the tasks â€” but we encouraged new programmers to aim to have attempted all of
phase 3 before the submission deadline.

{: .suggest}
See **[about the students](../teaching/students)** in the _Teaching_ section
and the [design philosophy](../about/design) behind the project.
