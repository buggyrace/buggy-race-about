# The Python project (what students do)

Each student develops a small Python Flask webserver that stores the
specification of a racing buggy in a local database. They can edit the buggy
(for example, changing the number of wheels) and output the buggy specification
as JSON data.

Uploading that JSON data to the race server enters the buggy for the next
race.

The project consists of around 26 tasks arranged in 7 phases. Phases must
be completed in order, but students are free to implement tasks as thoroughly
as their level allows.

The complexity of the tasks generally increases as the student works through
the phases.

## Flask serving on localhost

The project uses Flask, a lightweight webserver, which students hit in their
browser using `localhost`.

The project can support students working on their own machines, college
machines, or in the cloud using services like PythonAnywhere or Replit.
