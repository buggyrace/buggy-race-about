# Assessment

{: .todo}
This page is not quite ready: the documentation is still being written! _(July 2023)_.

The race server does **not** perform any assessment. There's a lot of variation
on how a development project like this _could_ be assessed. There's also scope
for a lot of opinion as to how a dev project like this _should_ be assessed.

{: rhul}
We will be adding some notes based on our general observations about how
we assessed these projects.  
<br>
There's no doubt that the most benefit to the students came about as a
result of working (even remotely) _with the oversight of a member of staff_.
The value of learning on a programming project is maximised by intervention and
support **at the moment of solving the problem** â€” assessment of submitted
work, and feedback relating to programming therein that the student reads
_weeks_ after having completed it may be important for academic progression but
probably isn't a useful way to develop understanding or capability.
