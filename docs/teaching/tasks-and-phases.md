# Tasks and phases

{: .todo}
This isn't ready yet: the documentation is still being written.


{: .demo}
See the [default task list]({{site.content.demo_url}}/project/tasks).

The Buggy Racing project work that the students must undertake is broken up
into tasks, and the tasks are grouped into phases.

Tasks are grouped into phases which **must be tackled in order**: don’t allow
your students to start a phase until they’ve completed all the task in the
previous phases.

However, with the pragmatic exception of phase 0, students can do the tasks
_within each phase_ in any order they want.

Furthermore, students can **decide how thoroughly** to implement any tasks.

Finally, it's inevitable (and deliberate) that the open-ended nature of the
tasks, and their increasing complexity, means that **students are not expected
to complete all the tasks**.

{: .note}
You can set the config setting `PROJECT_PHASE_MIN_TARGET` to indicate which
**phase** you expect most of your students to reach. By default, this is set
to `3` but will vary depending on the nature of your students (are they
mostly beginners, or do they already have experience in web development?). If
you set it to `0` then no recommendation will be shown.

{: .rhul}
This fluid approach — letting students decide how thouroughly to address each
task — worked well with the range of students. Inevitably, some students do
the mimimum. But most engaged students did a lot more. It's also common — and
a good indicator of a growing strategy of approaching software development —
to see students revisit tasks to add more coverage to them.
