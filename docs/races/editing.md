# Editing races

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Races** → Race: **Details** → **Edit**

You can edit the details of a race after you've created it.

The setting _Is visible?_ can be used to hide a race entirely from the students.
This can be useful if you've prepared a race (the first race, for example) but
haven't decided when to run it. We recommend _not_ running races right from the
start of the project, so that students can make some progress on their editors
before the first race.

{: .note }
The public `/races` page only ever shows **one** future race — the next one.
So if you have ten races, all visible, only the _next_ one will appear on that
page (together with all past ones that are not hidden).

The setting _Are results visible?_ can be used to hide races while you are
working on them. You can check that the results (and replaying) work as
expected before publishing them to the students.

## Changing races after results have been uploaded

You can usefully change the visibility of races (or fix typos). Otherwise,
changing some details about the race after you've uploaded the results may not
be helpful. It won't change the results, and it won't affect what is shown in
the race player either (because that gets its data entirely from the race file).
If you mean to change these things, upload a new race file.

If you upload a race file _after_ you've already done so, the existing results 
**will be deleted** before being replaced with the new ones.

## Deleting a race

{: .navigation}
**Admin** → **Races** → Race: **Details** → **Delete**

You can delete a race. If you do so, its results will also be removed.
