# Racing the students' buggies

## How to run a race

Steps for running a race:

* **[Create a race on the server](creating)**  
  Pick a racetrack, a cost limit, and the date and time it will start. Choose
  "Race is visible" so students can see it, and maybe advertise it with
  an announcement.

* **When the race is due to be run, [download the race file](downloading)**  
  It's a JSON file containing all the data needed for running the race,
  including a snapshot of the buggies that are on the server at that moment,
  and therefore automatically entered in the race.

* **[Run the race](running)**  
  The race file you downloaded is the input to the program that runs the race.
  It produces a new race file that now includes the results, and the events
  that occurred in the race.

*  **[Upload the race file](uploading-results) (now with results)**  
  This loads the results into the database on the server. If you publish the
  race file on the web (which, by default, happens on the race server),
  students can also **[replay the race](replaying)**.
